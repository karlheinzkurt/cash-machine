# Motivation
Just a playground project to explore the Rust programming language and OpenFaaS. Since I'm 
quite used to C++, I wanted to find out the advantages of Rust. Furthermore, I'm 
concerned about size of docker images in real world projects and I would like to find ways to implement
features in languages providing a sufficient ecosystem but keeping the image size of the increasing
number of docker images as small as possible. 

# What it does?
Takes an amount of money as an argument and calculates the notes to be paid out to the customer (without any practical use, just to play).
